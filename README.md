# ytDownloaderV2

Hi,

in order for this program to work you must have python installed on your pc.

Take a look at these guides if you don't have it installed.

Windows:
https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-windows

Linux:
https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/

MacOs:
https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/

********************************************************

Next you need to install "pytube" and "PySimpleGUI" by typing in the command line:

pip3 install pytube
pip install pysimplegui

********************************************************

Now open "ytDownloader.py" as a text file and insert the directory 
in which you want the downloaded file to be saved between the single quotes.
And save.

e.g.

stream.download('D:\Download2\YTDownloads')  <-- this won't probably work on your pc

********************************************************

Once this is done all you have to do is go inside the directory 
where the file "ytDownloader" is saved, from the command line, (CMD or other) and type:

python3 ytDownloaderV2.py 

and just follow the instructions on screen

REMEMBER TO ALWAYS PASTE YOUR LINK OR IT WILL CRASH (update is coming up)


ENJOY.
